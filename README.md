This project is built for Mac and Windows, although most testing occurs on MacOS. Compiled builds are available at the link above. The MacOS builds are signed and notarized. However, the Windows builds are not. 

In version 2 of MSC Monitor, the UI has been revamped to show the data in columns instead of big blogs of text, the program will now remember where it was placed and how it was sized, and there is a filemenu option to save the log out as a CSV file. 

Use is pretty self-explanatory, select the interface you would like to monitor at the top, if you connect or disconnect an interface you may need to click "Refresh Interfaces." The most recently received message will always be highlighted in a dark blue color. Selected rows will be highlighted in a lighter blue.
